# Weather Journal App
A simple application that is an exercise on web APIs, fetch API and `async` functions.  
You can enter a zip code (with optional ISO 3166 country code) in format `{zipCode},{countryCode}` in the zipcode input  
The application will try to fetch the weather data from [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/),  
and show the temperature with the current date, when the user press the Generate button

This project is built for [Udacity web development professional track](https://egfwd.com/web/) as a task.
